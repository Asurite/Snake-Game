# Snake game 🐍

Snake is a sub-genre of action video games where the player maneuvers the end of a growing line, often themed as a snake. The player must keep the snake from colliding with both other obstacles and itself, which gets harder as the snake lengthens. 


## How to play

To move the snake around you can use the up, down, left and right arrow keys.

In this game your score is initialized at 2 as it conveys the size of the snake. 

Every time the snake crashes to the borders or to itself the score resets.
